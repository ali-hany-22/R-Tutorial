# 📊 R Programming Tutorials & Notes

Welcome to my **R Programming** repository! 🚀

This project is designed to be a **continuous learning hub** for R. It currently starts with the absolute basics and core data structures, but it is an **ongoing project** where I will be uploading more advanced tutorials, scripts, and data analysis projects over time.

## 🚧 Project Status: [Active & Growing]
> *Last Update: 2026-01-11*

## 📂 Current Content (Part 1: The Fundamentals)

The current uploaded material (`R_Tutorial.Rmd`) covers the foundational building blocks of R:

### 1. **Core Syntax & Operations**
   - Variables, Data Types (Numeric, Integer, Character, Logical).
   - Mathematical & Logical Operators.
   - Built-in Math Functions.

### 2. **Control Flow**
   - **Conditions:** If, Else, Nested Logic.
   - **Loops:** While, For, Break/Next statements.
   - **Functions:** Creating functions, recursion, and scope.

### 3. **Data Structures (Detailed)**
   - **Vectors:** Sequences, sorting, and manipulation.
   - **Matrices:** 2D data handling and math.
   - **Lists:** Managing mixed data types.
   - **Data Frames:** The core of data analysis in R.
   - **Factors:** Categorical data.

## 🔜 Upcoming Content (Roadmap)

I plan to expand this repository to include:

- [ ] **Data Manipulation:** Using packages like `dplyr` and `tidyr`.
- [ ] **Data Visualization:** Creating charts with `ggplot2`.
- [ ] **Statistical Analysis:** Hypothesis testing and regression models.
- [ ] **Real-world Projects:** applying R to real datasets.
